        , a Swiss fintech startup, where I work on a hybrid application serving
        over 200,000 users. With a professional background in Angular and Ionic
        development I became proficient in crafting high-end scalable,
        performant and user-centric applications. I have experience working with
        Capacitor, Cordova, and other modern web technologies to bridge the gap
        between web and mobile. I'm also proficient in React and React Native
        and have worked on many projects using these technologies. I worked on
        multiple projects for local businesses and conversions of designs into
        code at Upwork.
