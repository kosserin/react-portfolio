        , a Swiss fintech startup, where I develop a mobile application serving
        over 200,000 users. What began as an interest in gaming evolved into a
        passion for computers, user interactivity, and graphics. Originally
        trained as a Mechanical Engineer, I transitioned into software
        engineering to merge my love for technology and design.

        With a professional background in Angular and Ionic development, I
        specialize in crafting responsive and performant applications. I have
        experience working with Capacitor, Cordova, and other modern web
        technologies to bridge the gap between web and mobile. I'm also
        proficient in React and React Native and have worked on many projects
        using these technologies. I worked on multiple projects for local
        businesses and conversions of designs into code at Upwork.
