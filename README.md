# My portfolio

Yep, here it is. My portfolio made with React. 
On the next link you can see the design I've made in Figma:

On the link above you can find colors I used, typography, images and everything for the design.

When user comes to the website, first he sees is my logo being drawn and moved to the top left corner. The dilemma for me was if logo should go opacity: 0 and scale: 0 and just appear on the top left corner, or to just slide there, but I believe that selected transition feels way more natural to the user.

After that, side links appears from the sides, navigation on the top and content. I tried my best to make that landing page not overwhelming and to be filled yet not to much so the user feels frustrated. User can check for basic informations about me such as technologies I've worked with and how long I'm in the web development world.

Then user comes to my featured projects with link to github repository and live preview (if is available). This section was dynamically rendered, so I created local data file and based on number of object in that data(array), that's how many components will be rendered.

The same principle comes to the "Other Noteworthy Projects" with local data dynamically rendering and their links to the github and live preview.

At the end, there's place to contact me if user would like to hire me or ask me something.
